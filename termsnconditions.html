                    <li>Have a credit or debit card that we accept</li>

                    <li>When you place an order with us, you should receive an acknowledgement e-mail confirming
                        the receipt of your order. We then carry out a standard pre-authorisation check to make sure
                        there’s enough money on the card.</li>
                    <li>We only accept your order once the payment has been approved and we have debited the
                        payment card (the contract is then made based on these terms).
                        You may be able to cancel (not change) your order within a short period of ordering –
                        timings depend on your chosen delivery method (and will be set out in the acknowledgement
                        email). <b>You can’t change your order – you’ll need to cancel (and/or return original
                            item(s)), and re-order.</b></li>
                    <li>All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. Don’t fret, if there’s
                        an issue with an order, we’ll get in touch with you.</li>

                        an issue with an order, we’ll get in touch with you.</li>
                    <li>Very occasionally, we may need to refuse or cancel an order or close or freeze an account
                        (even if we have previously confirmed your order) – e.g. if we notice something unusual on
                        an order, an account, or if your order goes against unit limits as detailed on the product
                        display pages of specific products. If this happens to you and you think we’ve made a
                        mistake, please don’t take offence – get in touch with Customer Care and they’ll be happy to
                        speak to you about it.</li>

                      ordered, we will tell you ASAP and give you the option of reconfirming your order (at the
                      correct price) or cancelling it.</li>

                      Don’t worry, as long as an item is still in its original condition, we accept returns, subject to
                      the rules below.</li>
                    <li>You will be granted a period of 7 days from the day your order gets delivered to return the
                      product(s). If you return an item requesting a refund within 7 days of the item(s) being
                      delivered to you, we&#39;ll give you a full refund by way of the original payment method. We will
                      not accept any returns once this time frame has ended.</li>
                    <li>You will, however, only be reimbursed for the amount paid for the product(s). Delivery
                      charges will not be refunded.</li>
                    <li>Kindly note that you will need to courier the item(s) on your own, and this will have to be
                      processed within 7 days, from the date of receiving your order.</li>
                    <li>You will also be required to share the courier tracking ID with us.</li>
                    <li>You will be responsible for the cost of returning any item(s).</li>
                    <li>For all returns, we aim to reimburse you within 10-15 days of having received the returned
                      item into our warehouse and condition checks are processed.</li>
                    <li>If you request a refund for an item during the above time frame but you can&#39;t return it to us
                      for some reason, please get in touch – but any refund will be at our discretion.</li>
                    <li>We don’t accept returns for select items, as mentioned in our return policy. Please check
                      product descriptions before you order.</li>
                    <li>Of course, its fine to try an item on like you would in a shop, but please don’t actually wear
                      it. If an item is returned to us damaged, worn or in an unsuitable condition, we won’t be able
                      to give you a refund and we may have to send it back to you (and ask you to cover the
                      delivery costs). Alternatively, we (at our sole discretion) may choose to reduce your refund to
                      reflect any reduction in the value of an item.</li>
                    <li>All returned items should be sent in their original condition and packaging where possible,
                      including tags.</li>
